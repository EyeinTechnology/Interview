##Instructions for Java exercise – SMS messages
3 users with a smartphone each, are sending SMS messages simultaneously. The messages are sent to a message broker that distributes the messages to the following consumers:
1.	Print service – prints all the messages to the console.
2.	Word count service – counts all the words that appear in the messages:
a.	Total occurrences per word.
b.	Total occurrences per word per user.
###Part I – Implementation (45 minutes)
Your task is to implement the scenario described above, where some of the classes are already given. You will need to implement the following interfaces:
1.	`MessageBroker`
2.	`WordCountService`
Run the program using the test class `SmartphoneTest`.
###Part II – Discussion (30 minutes)
In this part, we ask you to explain what you did in the previous part and what are the considerations and problems you encountered during the implementation. 

**Important:** Full implementation of the exercise is not mandatory. The main idea is how you approach the problem and the considerations you take implementing it.
